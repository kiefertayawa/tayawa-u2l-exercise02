Steps on how to create Github page:

1. Make sure that your repository is already published and pushed in the remote repository (accessible in Github online)
2. Navigate to the Settings tab
3. Navigate to the Pages option
4. Under Build and deployment: Select Github Actions then Deploy from a branch
5. Under Branch, select the /root folder then Save.
6. It may take a few minutes, go to your Github.io page by the URL

Key takeaways:
My key takeaways for this exercise is that I should practice more when doing CSS and HTML exercises.
Doing this exercise is not that hard, I only must be patient and not scared to try new things. Also,
there are many resources available on the web, I just have to be creative when using them.
