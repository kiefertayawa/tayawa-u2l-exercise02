Steps on how to create Github page:
1. Open github and log in using up mail account
2. Click "+" button to create new repository and add name as desired
3. On your local repository, initialize before adding, committing, and pushing (git init, put user.name/user.email)
4. From time to time, add, commit, and push to remote repository to add checkpoints between codes
5. Check your github if the repository is updated, verify by checking if your username is visible and viewing commits


Key takeaways:
My key takeaways for this exercise is that I should practice more when doing CSS and HTML exercises. 
Doing this exercise is not that hard, I only must be patient and not scared to try new things. Also, 
there are many resources available on the web, I just have to be creative when using them.
